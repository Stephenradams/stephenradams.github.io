### Hi! I'm Stephen 

I'm a web developer with over 20 years experience, I'm a big fan of Typescript and the whole Typescript eco-system.

I've worked with Vue and Angular, as well as things like C#, ASP.Net and even ColdFusion. 

This blog is for me to write about Typescript and any other tech things I want to write about.
